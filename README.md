# üõ†Ô∏è Base Auto-LP Vault

**Automated ETH/USDC liquidity allocation and yield farming on Base (Uniswap V3, Aerodrome, Aave idle buffer) via a single ERC-4626 vault.**

---

## Overview

Base Auto-LP Vault is a modular, upgradeable ERC-4626 vault that accepts ETH (wrapped to WETH) and USDC on Base mainnet. It automatically allocates liquidity across:

- **Uniswap V3**: Concentrated liquidity position in the WETH/USDC pool.
- **Aerodrome Slipstream**: LP for the same pair, staked in its gauge to earn $AERO rewards.
- *(Planned)* **Aave v3**: Idle reserve for unallocated funds.

Shares represent proportional ownership of all underlying assets and accrued fees/incentives. Admin (Safe multisig) can change weights, pause, and upgrade the vault.

---

## Architecture

- **Vault (ERC-4626)**: Accepts deposits/withdrawals, manages shares, and interacts with the Allocator.
- **Allocator**: Routes funds to strategies based on target weights.
- **Strategies**: Modular contracts for Uniswap V3, Aerodrome, and (future) Aave.
- **Upgradeable**: UUPS proxy pattern via OpenZeppelin.
- **Security**: ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, Ownable/AccessControl.

## Features

- Single deposit for multi-venue LP farming
- Automated rebalancing and fee harvesting
- Modular, extensible strategy architecture
- Upgradeable and pausable for safety
- Thoroughly tested with Foundry (unit, fuzz, invariant)
